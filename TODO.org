* ICASSP

- Do a few semi-supervised learning examples 
- Do a few graph denoising examples

* Medium term

- Generalise implementation of Wilson's alg. to weighted graphs, in an efficient
  manner. Problem: the SimpleWeightedGraph class uses a sparse matrix to store
  weights, which makes random lookups very inefficient. Should implement a type
  that uses a list of lists. Maybe ask the JuliaGraphs folks? 
- Improve implementation of smoothing: we can directly compute average on the
  tree using a forward-backward loop.
